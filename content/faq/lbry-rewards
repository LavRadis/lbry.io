LBRY application rewards the users with LBRY credits (LBC) for specific actions that they do. Rewards are given to promote application testing, learning certain in-app skills, build the LBRY economy, and as a small "thank you" gift. Rewards are issued automatically by the LBRY app. 
In order to get LBRY rewards users have to get verified. Users can get verified via the LBRY Discord chat process by providing their email, or with credit card information.   
LBRY application works with full functionality without the user verification, but users will not be able to receive any rewards.
